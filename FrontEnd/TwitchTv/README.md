# FreeCodeCamp
## [Zipline: Use the Twitchtv JSON API](http://www.freecodecamp.com/challenges/zipline-use-the-twitchtv-json-api)

<br />User Story: I can see whether Free Code Camp is currently streaming on Twitch.tv.
<br />User Story: I can click the status output and be sent directly to the Free Code Camp's Twitch.tv channel.
<br />User Story: if Free Code Camp is streaming, I can see additional details about what they are streaming.
<br />User Story: I will see a placeholder notification if a streamer has closed their Twitch account. You can verify this works by adding brunofin and comster404 to your array of Twitch streamers.
